# Property-Listing

Poperty Lising front-end web application. Developed using React.

### Installation

In order to get the project up and running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/finn-harman/Property-Listing.git
$ cd Property-Listing
$ cd app
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Notes:
* I was unable to figure out how to implement editable fields within the time constraints. My intuition was to call fetch a POST request to the server I created, but it did not seem to work when my server is just a json file.
